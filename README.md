This is a Project priority matrix project  in excel created during the codebasics bootcamp
A Project Priority Matrix is a visual tool used to prioritize tasks or projects based on their urgency and importance. It typically involves categorizing tasks or projects into quadrants based on two key factors:

Urgency: How soon does the task or project need to be addressed?
Importance: How significant is the task or project in relation to overall project goals or objectives? The matrix is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different level of urgency and importance:
Urgent and Important (Quadrant I): Tasks or projects in this quadrant are both urgent and crucial. They require immediate attention and are critical to the success of the project. Important but Not Urgent (Quadrant II): Tasks or projects in this quadrant are significant for the project's success but not time-sensitive. Planning and scheduling these items strategically is key.
Urgent but Not Important (Quadrant III): Tasks or projects in this quadrant are time-sensitive but may not directly contribute to the project's long-term goals. Delegating or finding efficient ways to handle them is important.
Not Urgent and Not Important (Quadrant IV): Tasks or projects in this quadrant are neither urgent nor crucial. They may be considered for later or may not require immediate attention. Using a Project Priority Matrix helps project managers and teams allocate resources effectively, focus on critical tasks, and maintain a balance between urgent and important activities.
It is a valuable tool for project planning, time management, and decision-making.
